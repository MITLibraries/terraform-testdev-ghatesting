# The snippet below is used in the stage/prod environment to pull in shared data. It won't work
#   in the test/dev environment because of the specific calls to the bucket, workspaces, and locks
#   that only exist in the stage/prod environment. We will need to build a separate module, specific
#   to the test/dev environment that does the same thing.
#
# This is an edit in shared/app that should trigger the conditional validate.
#
# This will pull in the custom module that is stored locally in this template
