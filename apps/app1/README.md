# Apps / App1

This is dummy Terraform code for GitHub Actions testing.

## What's created?

* Nothing. All the variables are now stored in the correct path.

## Additional Info

As part of the `terraform plan` testing, we'll need to setup variables in the AWS SSM Parameter Store in the proper path for easy consumption by the AWS CLI. Everything will have to be organized properly so that a generic python script can move the data from AWS to a .tfvars file to be consumed by the GitHub Action.
