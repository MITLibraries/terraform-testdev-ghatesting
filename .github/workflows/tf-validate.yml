    #   Terraform changes. The output from this job is a "matrix", basically a list of subfolders where the 
    #   Terraform commands should run. This will ONLY run the terraform validate on the subfolders where there 
    #   are actual changes and it will ignore the rest of the repository.

        # On the very first push of a new branch to GitHub, the `github.event.before` is all zeros (because
        #   there are no previous commits on the branch). To address this, the run command does a quick test
        #   and if it's the first commit on a new branch, it forces a comparison to the most recent commit
        #   on `origin/master` instead. For every subsequent commit, it compares the current commit on the branch
        #   to the prior commit on the branch. The result of this step is a list of folder paths containing changes
        #   to Terraform code. This list is used in the next step.
        #
        # The awk/sed/grep filtering on the output from `git diff` does the following
        #   * isolates just the folder paths (awk)
        #   * strips trailing slashes (sed)
        #   * strips subfolders that do not contain .tf files (grep -vE)
        #   * removes top-level folders that only hold subfolders and not .tf files (grep -E)
        # The final line before setting the outpu from this step is to escape newlines (replace \n with %0A)

  #   job: the AWS region and the AWS access key and secret (the latter two are stored as secrets in the GitHub

  #   credentials and some of our code requires that it is run in a workspace, so we set `TF_WORKSPACE` to `stage`.
